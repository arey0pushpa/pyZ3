We demonstrate in our work how local regulatory interactions between molecules of the VTS, translate
into a global, observable properties of the VTS. 
%
Interactions between SNARE proteins and their
regulators, which in its simplest form can be encoded in a pairing matrix, constrain the topological
properties of the transport graph; all VTSs based on v-SNARE t-SNARE interactions must be 2-strongly connected.
% 
Additionally, we demonstrate how we can aid in predicting new vesicles given an incomplete VTS as input. 
%
Our approach demonstrates the power of SMT solvers in a novel application and the value of careful encoding of the problems into SMT queries. 
%
We manage to scale the tool up
to the size that makes the tool biologically relevant.
%To conclude, we have established a connection between vesicle transport graph connectedness and underlying rules of SNARE pairing and regulation. 
%%
%The constraints implied by SNARE protein properties translates into
%mathematically elegant properties of the transport graph, namely its connectivity.
%%
%Our approach demonstrates the power of SMT solvers in a {\em novel} application and the value of careful encoding of the problems into SMT queries. 
%We manage to scale the tool up to the size that makes the tool biologically relevant.
%

However, the problem of searching for all $k$-connected VTSs induces quantifier alternation in the encodings.
%
Therefore, a simple call to SAT solver may not work efficiently. 
%
We used QBF solvers for such queries.
%
Our connectivity results contain many predictions which can in principle be tested through cell-biological experiments. 
%
One may also be interested in counting the number of graphs that satisfy
a given property. 
%
Exact counting of the graphs using SAT solvers may prove to be very
difficult. 
%
We are planning to employ approximate counting methods for finding the solution.
%

We also presented encodings of the synthesis problems that may arise from VTSs.
%
We demonstrated that our tool based on the encodings
scale up to the relevant sizes of the VTSs for some synthesis queries.
%
Our tool timed out on larger examples.
%
We are working to improve the performance of our tool.
%
%
With the tool, we made an attempt to present multiple new testable predictions. 
%
We will take this tool to the biologists and develop wet experiments that may
validate some synthesis results from the tool.
%
%These predictions may very likely increase to hasten discoveries in this field alongside pushing forward the use of formal methods in the biological field.
%

Since our current knowledge of VTSs is not extensive and there are many missing parts,
there is a huge space of potential predictions.
%
We also developing methods to prioritize predictions considering addition biological
information and using a refined model.
%
For example, in this work, we have only analyzed the VTS as static graphs. A major aspect of the biological cellâ€™s VTS that the current model is missing is \textit{compartment maturation}, imbalances in incoming and outgoing molecular flux on vesicles.
%
In the future, we will study the dynamic behaviors of VTSs.
