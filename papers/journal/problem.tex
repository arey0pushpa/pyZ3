\noindent %\improve{The weakest part of the paper; Need a serious rewrite!}
We analyze the model against our desired properties.
%
%Since in biology there are no declared specifications or properties, we conjecture some properties that appear to be 
%true in  relevant inall the known biological systems.
%
In this paper, we choose graph connectedness to be a key property.
%
We categorize the search problem into three different categories (Fig.~\ref{fig:vts-search}), search problem for the existential condition, search problem for the universal condition, and performing synthesis on the incomplete VTS. 
%
We will present two encodings for existential condition and one each for universal condition and synthesis.

\noindent We will also seek to answer two kinds of questions given the property.
% %
% In this paper,
% our conjecture relates graph-connectedness to a particular variation of SNARE pairing and
% regulation rules of the VTS.
% %
% We are interested in the following two type of properties of the transport graph:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Existential condition}:
if there is a VTS that satisfies the connectedness property. 

\item {\em Universal condition}:
  if there is a connectedness property that is satisfied by each valid VTS.
\end{enumerate}
The goal is to find the minimum graph connectivity properties for each of the condition.
% In our program, the rules VTS needs to follow 
% %
% are represented as constrained over the transport graphs (G), label on the nodes and edges and activity of those labels (determined by a Boolean function f). 
% %
% Each of these constrained functions is defined to be TRUE for a G and f: if and only if the corresponding condition holds for the given G and f. 
% %
% We use these functions to define the assertion that characterizes the corresponding condition to be checked. 
% %
% We will show in later sections how we encode these Boolean functions. 
\subsection{Search for existential condition} 
%
% To ensure that k-connectedness is an existential condition,
%
We need to find a $k$-connected graph that satisfies all the rules (and constraints) of the system. 
%
We also aim to find the minimum $k$. 
%
%Let's fix our conjecture: ``k-connectedness is a necessary condition for the system regulated by a Boolean function on the node and SNARE-SNARE inhibition on the edge". 
%
To find a $k$-connected graph we specify our property as a query for the existence
of a model for a conjunction of the formula representing stability, fusion and specific
graph connectivity constraint. 
%
% \begin{align*}
%   &\texttt{LabeledVTS} = \texttt{Stability} \, \land \, \texttt{Fusion} \land \, \texttt{MinConnectivity(k)}
%  \tag{E}\label{eq:existcond}
% \end{align*}
%
We will start with the value of $k = 1$ and check for the satisfiability of the formula.
%
In case the formula is satisfiable the procedure terminates and we report the value of $k$. 
%
If the formula is not satisfiable we increment the $k$ by $1$ and repeat the same procedure. 
%
In this way, we ensure that the reported $k$ is the minimum connectivity of the VTS that
satisfies the existential condition.
%

The implementation of the $k$-connectedness property is challenging as it requires reasoning about all possible $k - 1$ edge removals. 
%
So instead of checking for the graph to be $k$-connected, the encoding (and the implementation) checks whether the graph is not $k+1$-connected.
%
Note that this check returns correct $k$, as we are starting from smallest $k$ ($k = 1$) and subsequently incrementing it by one.     
% Used E as edge and L_e L_n as label for node and the edge,

We employ two techniques to examine the existential condition. 
%
First, using the BMC and second using SMT solving.
%
Throughout the paper, we will address these two subcategories as $\fbmc$ and $\fsmt$ search problems.
%
%Here, we present both the $\fbmc$ and $\fsmt$ search problem for the existential condition.
%
%\subsubsection{$\fbmc$ search problem.}
%For a given $k$, size $\nu$, molecule number $\mu$, and unwinding depth $w$,
%we are searching for well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS
%$G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ such that
%$|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$, and $G$ is not $k$-connected, within $w$ depth of unwinding.    
%
%\subsubsection{$\fsmt$ search problem.}
%For a given $k$, size $\nu$, and molecule number $\mu$,
%we are searching for well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS
%$G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ such that
%$|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$, and
%$G$ is not $k$-connected.    


\subsection{Search for universal condition}
%
% Similarly, for the conjecture that k-connectedness is a universal condition for the VTS,
For some $k>0$,
we have to ensure that every graph of $k$-connected structure satisfies all
the rules of the system.
%
We also aim to find the minimum $k$. 
% We also have to ensure that the particular k is the least one. 
%
This condition can be specified as: for every $k$-connected graph, there exists a satisfiable assignment following the rules of the system. 
%
% \begin{align*}
%   & \forall G \, \texttt{Connectivity(k)} \implies  \exists
%                         f,p: \texttt{Stability} \, \land \, \texttt{Fusion}  
%   \tag{U}\label{eq:univcond}
% \end{align*}
%
We will use the same procedure as the existential condition to ensure that $k$ is minimized.
%

%In the implementation, to conclude that a given $k$-connectedness is not a universal condition it is suffice to search for a $k$-connected graph that has no satisfying assignment of all the rules of the system, i.e., checking the negation of the condition is unsatisfiable.
%In the implementation, to conclude that a given $k$-connectedness is not a universal condition we search for a $k$-connected graph that has no satisfying assignment of all the rules of the system, i.e., checking the negation of the condition is unsatisfiable.
%
 
The formula for the problem has quantifier alternation. 
%
Most SAT solvers can check (at least efficiently) only quantifier-free formulas.
%
%
We need a QBF solver for such queries. 
%
We refer the corresponding search problem as $\fqbf$ search problem.
%

For the efficient implementation of the specification instead of checking the satisfiability of the formula, we check whether the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. 
%
That is to conclude that a given $k$-connectedness is not a universal condition we search for a $k$-connected graph that has no satisfying assignment to all the rules of the system.
%
%In case no such graph exists for a specific $k$ we report the $k$.
%%\ankit{This is a dummy template. need a rewrite.} 
%\subsubsection{$\fqbf$ search problem.} For a given $k$, size $\nu$, and molecule number $\mu$, we are searching for a $k$-connected graph such that there is no assignment that makes it a well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS $G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ with $|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$.    

%
%In this section, we will present a list of synthesis problems that may
%arise from the partially available information about a VTS and our synthesis method
%for the problems.

%\subsection{Problem Statements}
\subsection{Synthesis of VTS}
%
\noindent We also consider another variant of analysis of VTSs.
%
We will assume that we are given a VTS, whose all components
are not specified.
%
Our objective is to find the missing components.
%
The missing component can
% be in any of the components of VTS. 
%
%For example, 
be some undiscovered edges or nodes, or insufficient
knowledge about the presence of molecules in some part of the VTS.
%
To cover most of the likely variations of this missing information,
we have encoded the following variants of the VTS synthesis problem.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fixing VTS by adding edges 
	\item Fixing VTS by adding molecules to the labels
	\item Fixing VTS by learning activity functions
	% \begin{enumerate}
	%   \item kcnf: low depth circuit.
	%   \item Boolean gates: And, Or.
	%   \item Boolean gates with linear combination.  
	% \end{enumerate}        
	% - Function dependence with var occurring once.
	\item  Fixing VTS by both adding/deleting components
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Synthesis problem.}

We will do synthesis against the property that the VTS
is stable and 3-connected.
%
% The property is designed to balance the search space such that the synthesis procedure does not
% succeed with simply adding too many edges. 
%
%\begin{align*}
%\texttt{Property} =  \texttt{Stability} \land \texttt{Connected}(3) 
%%\land \texttt{DisConnected}(4)
%\end{align*}
This property was proposed in~\cite{shukla2017discovering}.
%
However, the biological relevance of the property is debatable and open for change.
%

%To handle this challenge, we used a combination of nondeterminism and Boolean enumeration at the C-source level to eliminate quantifiers, as explained further below.
