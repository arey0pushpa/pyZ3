This section will present the different search problems of VTS.

\subsection{Existential condition}

Based upon earlier discussion, we need to answer the following search
question among VTSs.
%
Here, we will present both BMC and SMT search problem.

\textbf{SMT Search problem:}
For a given $k$, size $\nu$, and molecule number $\mu$,
we are searching for well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS
$G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ such that
$|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$, and
$G$ is not $k$-connected.    

\noindent
The notion of stability and connectivity varies slightly for BMC encoding. 
%In this subsection, we will present the concept of stability and connectivity for BMC encoding. 
%
We call a graph $G$ {\em stable} if for each $(n,M',n') \in \edges$ and $m \in M'$,
there exists a $m$-path in G with $n_1 = n'$ and $n_\ell = n$.
%
%
We call a graph $G$ {\em connected} if for each $n,n' \in \nodes$,
$n'$ there is a path from $n$ to $n'$ in G.
%
We call a graph $G$ $k$-connected if for each $\edges' \subseteq \edges$ and $|\edges'| < k$,
VTS $(\nodes,\mols,\edges-E',\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ is connected.
%	
We use $m$-${path}_i^j$ to denote an $m$-path between source node i and target node is j. 

For the experimentation, we will restrict ourselves to the elementary cycles (cycles of length one). 
%
This restriction puts an upper limit of N-1 on the length of each searched path. 
%
Creating a formula to search a path of length N-1 for each molecule m on every edge E will be extremely large and harder for the solvers to handle.  
%
Even if there exist shorter paths we have to create the formula of maximum size N-1. 
% 
To resolve these problems we will use a technique called bounded model checking, where the depth of the path can be specified and consequently increased or decreased.  
%
This specified depth is called unwinding in the technical terms.

\textbf{BMC Search problem:}
For a given $k$, size $\nu$, molecule number $\mu$, and unwinding depth w,
we are searching for well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS
$G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ such that
$|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$, and $G$ is not $k$-connected with w depth of unwinding.    

\subsection{QBF and synthesis}
Here we will present the QBF and Synthesis search problem.

 \todo{A dummy template} \textbf{QBF search problem:}
For a given $k$, size $\nu$, and molecule number $\mu$,
we are searching for well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS
$G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ such that
$|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$,and
$G$ is not $k$-connected.    

%
%In this section, we will present a list of synthesis problems that may
%arise from the partially available information about a VTS and our synthesis method
%for the problems.

%\subsection{Problem Statements}
\textbf{Synthesis problem statement:}
We will assume that we are given a VTS, whose all components
are not specified.
%
Our objective is to find the missing parts.
%
The missing parts can be in any of the components of VTS. 
%
For example, some undiscovered edges or nodes, or insufficient
knowledge about the presence of molecules in some part of the VTS.
%
To cover most of the likely variations of this missing information,
we have encoded the following variants of VTS synthesis problem.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fixing VTS by adding edges 
	\item Fixing VTS by adding molecules to the labels
	\item Fixing VTS by learning activity functions
	% \begin{enumerate}
	%   \item kcnf: low depth circuit.
	%   \item Boolean gates: And, Or.
	%   \item Boolean gates with linear combination.  
	% \end{enumerate}        
	% - Function dependence with var occurring once.
	\item  Fixing VTS by both adding/deleting parts
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Encoding synthesis property}

We will do synthesis against the following property that says the VTS
is stable and 3-connected.
%
% The property is designed to balance the search space such that the synthesis procedure does not
% succeed with simply adding too many edges. 
%
\begin{align*}
\texttt{Property} =  \texttt{Stability} \land \texttt{Connected}(3) 
%\land \texttt{DisConnected}(4)
\end{align*}
The property was proposed in~\cite{shukla2017discovering}.
%
However, the biological relevance of the property is debatable and open for change.
%
Our tool is easily modifiable to support any other property that may be deemed 
interesting by the biologists.
