\noindent %\improve{The weakest part of the paper; Need a serious rewrite!}
We analyze the model against our desired properties.
%
%Since in biology there are no declared specifications or properties, we conjecture some properties that appear to be 
%true in  relevant inall the known biological systems.
%
In this paper, we choose graph connectedness to be a key property.

We categorize the search problem (Fig.~\ref{fig:vts-search}) into three different categories, search problem for the existential condition, search problem for the universal condition, and performing synthesis on the incomplete VTS. 
%
We will present two encodings for existential condition and one each for universal condition and synthesis.

%
We will also seek two kinds of questions give the property.
% %
% In this paper,
% our conjecture relates graph-connectedness to a particular variation of SNARE pairing and
% regulation rules of the VTS.
% %
% We are interested in the following two type of properties of the transport graph:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Existential condition}:
if there is a VTS that satisfies the connectedness property. 

\item {\em Universal condition}:
  if there is a connectedness property that is satisfied by each valid VTS.
\end{enumerate}
The goal is to find the minimum graph connectivity properties for each of the condition.
% In our program, the rules VTS needs to follow 
% %
% are represented as constrained over the transport graphs (G), label on the nodes and edges and activity of those labels (determined by a Boolean function f). 
% %
% Each of these constrained functions is defined to be TRUE for a G and f: if and only if the corresponding condition holds for the given G and f. 
% %
% We use these functions to define the assertion that characterizes the corresponding condition to be checked. 
% %
% We will show in later sections how we encode these Boolean functions. 
\subsubsection{Search for existential condition} 
%
% To ensure that k-connectedness is an existential condition,
%
We need to find a $k$-connected graph that satisfies all the rules (and constraints) of the system. 
%
We also aim to find the minimum $k$. 
%
%Let's fix our conjecture: ``k-connectedness is a necessary condition for the system regulated by a Boolean function on the node and SNARE-SNARE inhibition on the edge". 
%
To find a k-connected graph we specify our property as a query for the existence
of a model for a conjunction of the formula representing stability, fusion and specific
graph connectivity constraint. 
%
% \begin{align*}
%   &\texttt{LabeledVTS} = \texttt{Stability} \, \land \, \texttt{Fusion} \land \, \texttt{MinConnectivity(k)}
%  \tag{E}\label{eq:existcond}
% \end{align*}
%
We will start with the value of $k = 1$ and check for the satisfiability of the formula.
%
In case the formula is satisfiable the procedure terminates and we report the value of $k$. 
%
If the formula is not satisfiable we increment the $k$ by $1$ and repeat the same procedure. 
%
In this way, we ensure that the reported $k$ is the minimum connectivity of the VTS that
satisfies the existential condition.
%
% Used E as edge and L_e L_n as label for node and the edge,

 We employ two techniques to examine the existential condition. 
%
First, using the bounded model checking (BMC) technique~\cite{biere1999symbolic1, biere2003bounded}.
%
%It  represents the executions of a program symbolically and 
%
%The Bounded model checking technique
%BMC is an automatic technique that performs a search for the violation of the property in the program executions whose length is bounded by some fixed positive integer value $w$ (\textit{unwinding depth}). 
%%
%The bounded execution is represented symbolically as a propositional formula and solved using a SAT solver.
%%
%In case there is no violation for a particular depth, one can progressively increase the depth until either property is violated, the problem becomes intractable, or an upper bound of the system is reached, indicating the satisfiability of the property.
%%
%For our case, the unwinding depth is total number of nodes in the graph.
%the maximum length of the path of the underline graph.
%
%
%For the experimentation, we restrict the check only to the elementary cycles; cycles of length one. 
%%
%This restriction puts an upper limit of the number of nodes on the length of the searched path. 
%
%
%and the upper bound is the number of nodes $N$.
Second, using constraint solving, where the rules are represented as a constraint over the variables defined in the system.
%
The search problem is to find an assignment of variables that satisfies all the specified constraints.
%
We have used SMT solving.

Throughout the paper, we will address these two subcategories as $\fbmc$ and $\fsmt$ search problems.
%The existential condition search problem is represented as a bounded model checking and constraint solving. 
%
%Based upon earlier discussion, we need to answer the following search question among VTSs.
%
Here, we present both the $\fbmc$ and $\fsmt$ search problem for the existential condition.

\subsubsection{$\fbmc$ search problem.}
For a given $k$, size $\nu$, molecule number $\mu$, and unwinding depth $w$,
we are searching for well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS
$G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ such that
$|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$, and $G$ is not $k$-connected, within $w$ depth of unwinding.    

\subsubsection{$\fsmt$ search problem.}
For a given $k$, size $\nu$, and molecule number $\mu$,
we are searching for well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS
$G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ such that
$|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$, and
$G$ is not $k$-connected.    


\subsubsection{Search for universal condition}
%
% Similarly, for the conjecture that k-connectedness is a universal condition for the VTS,
For some $k>0$,
we have to ensure that every graph of $k$-connected structure satisfies all
the rules of the system.
%
We also aim to find the minimum $k$. 
% We also have to ensure that the particular k is the least one. 
%
This condition can be specified as: for every k-connected graph, there exists a satisfiable assignment following the rules of the system. 
%
% \begin{align*}
%   & \forall G \, \texttt{Connectivity(k)} \implies  \exists
%                         f,p: \texttt{Stability} \, \land \, \texttt{Fusion}  
%   \tag{U}\label{eq:univcond}
% \end{align*}
%
We will use the same procedure as the existential condition to ensure the k to be the least one.
%
The formula for the problem has quantifier alternation. 
%
Most SAT solvers can check (at least efficiently) only quantifier-free formulas.
%
We need a QBF solver for such queries.
%
We will model the search problem for the universal condition as a QBF~\cite{buning2009theory, benedetti2008qbf}, and the resultant formula is solved using a QBF solver.
%
The QBF is a generalization of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which every variable is quantified using either existential or universal quantifier.
%
The QBFs enables potentially more succinct encodings than SAT~\cite{jussila2007compressing} although much more difficult~\cite{savitch1970relationships, stockmeyer1973word} to solve.

%\ankit{This is a dummy template. need a rewrite.} 
\subsubsection{$\fqbf$ search problem.} For a given $k$, size $\nu$, and molecule number $\mu$, we are searching for a $k$-connected graph such that there is no assignment that makes it a well-structured, stable, and well-fused VTS $G = (\nodes,\mols,\edges,\nlabel,\pairs,\edgef,\nodef)$ with $|\nodes| = \nu$, $|\mols| = \mu$.    

%
%In this section, we will present a list of synthesis problems that may
%arise from the partially available information about a VTS and our synthesis method
%for the problems.

%\subsection{Problem Statements}
\subsection{Synthesis of VTS}
%
\noindent We also consider another variant of analysis of VTSs.
%
We will assume that we are given a VTS, whose all components
are not specified.
%
Our objective is to find the missing parts.
%
The missing parts can be in any of the components of VTS. 
%
For example, some undiscovered edges or nodes, or insufficient
knowledge about the presence of molecules in some part of the VTS.
%
To cover most of the likely variations of this missing information,
we have encoded the following variants of the VTS synthesis problem.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fixing VTS by adding edges 
	\item Fixing VTS by adding molecules to the labels
	\item Fixing VTS by learning activity functions
	% \begin{enumerate}
	%   \item kcnf: low depth circuit.
	%   \item Boolean gates: And, Or.
	%   \item Boolean gates with linear combination.  
	% \end{enumerate}        
	% - Function dependence with var occurring once.
	\item  Fixing VTS by both adding/deleting parts
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Synthesis problem.}

We will do synthesis against the property that the VTS
is stable and 3-connected.
%
% The property is designed to balance the search space such that the synthesis procedure does not
% succeed with simply adding too many edges. 
%
%\begin{align*}
%\texttt{Property} =  \texttt{Stability} \land \texttt{Connected}(3) 
%%\land \texttt{DisConnected}(4)
%\end{align*}
This property was proposed in~\cite{shukla2017discovering}.
%
However, the biological relevance of the property is debatable and open for change.
%

%To handle this challenge, we used a combination of nondeterminism and Boolean enumeration at the C-source level to eliminate quantifiers, as explained further below.
