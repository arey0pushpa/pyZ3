We thank the reviewers for their careful reading, which helps us
improving the submission.

TODO: Structure of the paper
     - Improve the way to effectively communicate the biological 
       problem specifically to a computational audience. XXX
Reviewers 1 and 2 both felt that structure of the paper can be improved. 
Both reviewers felt the introduction section should provide high level 
overview to help the reader to see the big picture.
We have now updated the introduction section to give overview of the complete
work and in the next section we go into the details of biolgy.  
We have also combined the materials in Sec 1.5 and 1.6 with the introduction 
and merged Sec 1.2 and 1.3 as a separate section with detailed biological 
description (as suggested by reviewer 2).

TODO: Compare the to the previous results by the same authors.  XXX
Reviewer 2 asked for a comparision to the previous papers which is now been 
added as part of the introduction section, with providing link to the main 
paper upfront (as pointed out by Reviewer 1). 

TODO: Why should a biologist be concerned with
this property? XXX
Reviewer 3 pointed out that graph connectedness is not well motivated. 
He raise question of relevance of this property for a biologist?
It is often the case that biological data is missing. For example, only a few 
of the dozens of molecules involved in real VTSs have been mapped out. Therefore, 
it is extremely likely that the description provided by the cell biologist is 
incomplete. 
Can we find a simple test to see whether any information is missing, given the 
experimental data? The graph k-connectedness furnishes precisely such a test. 
If the data provided by cell-biologists, suitably represented as a graph, does not 
have a certain degree of connectivity, this implies that some biological data has 
been missed. (The converse is not true: even if the required connectivity does hold, 
there might of course be more information missing.)
We have added a complete paragraph to motivate the graph connectedness property and 
provided the above argument in detail as part of Sec 2. 

TODO: 
  - Experimentation setup: R3 XXX

We thank for the other comments, which we appropriately implemented.
