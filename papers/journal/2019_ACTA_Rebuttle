We would like to thank the reviewers for their very detailed and 
helpful comments. In the following, we ellaborate on how we addressed 
the feed in the revised version of our paper. 

TODO: Structure of the paper
     - Improve the way to effectively communicate the biological 
       problem specifically to a computational audience. XXX
Reviewers 1 and 2 both felt that structure of the paper can be improved. 
Both reviewers suggested the introduction section should provide high level 
overview to help the reader to see the big picture.
We have now updated the introduction section to give overview of the complete
work and in the next section we go into the details of biolgy.  
We have also combined the materials in Sec 1.5 and 1.6 with the introduction 
and merged Sec 1.2 and 1.3 as a separate section with detailed biological 
description (as suggested by reviewer 2).

  % R1: The weighting given to each section.

TODO: Compare the to the previous results by the same authors.  XXX
Reviewer 2 asked for a comparision to the previous papers which is now been 
added as part of the introduction section, with providing link to the main 
paper upfront (as pointed out by Reviewer 1). 

TODO: Why should a biologist be concerned with this property? XXX
Reviewer 3 pointed out that graph connectedness is not well motivated. 
It is often the case that biological data is missing. For example, only a few 
of the dozens of molecules involved in real VTSs have been mapped out. Therefore, 
it is extremely likely that the description provided by the cell biologist is 
incomplete. 
Can we find a simple test to see whether any information is missing, given the 
experimental data? The graph k-connectedness furnishes precisely such a test. 
If the data provided by cell-biologists, suitably represented as a graph, does not 
have a certain degree of connectivity, this implies that some biological data has 
been missed. (The converse is not true: even if the required connectivity does hold, 
there might of course be more information missing.)
We have added a complete paragraph to motivate the graph connectedness property and 
provided the above argument in detail as part of Sec 2. 

TODO: Technical details
  % R2: encoding details that were unclear
    - encoding cardinality constraints for k-connectivity
    - encoding of the (uninterpreted) activation functions f_m and g_m into SAT 
  
  % R2: Is the application of a QBF solver (or an exhaustive enumeration 
        over the universal quantification) necessary (Sec 4.0.2)?
    The section 4.0.2 provides a high level overview of the problem and indeed 
    in the implementation, we search for an UNSAT answer. This is evident from 
    the 5.2.1 QBF search problem. 
    The possible confusion can still persist so we have merged the Sec 4 Property 
    of interest and Sec 5 Search encodings together to avoid the same.
  
  % R2: I found the separation between problem statements (Sec 5) and Encoding
        (Sec 6) confusing.
   We now provide the search problem as a part of Sec 4 Property of Interest. 
   Stating the problem formally we think is interesting to some of the audience
   of the paper specially to formal methods community. Due to this restructing 
   a computational biologist can read the informal presentations and just gloss 
   over the formal ones.  

  % R2: Large parts of Sec 5 seem like background (e.g. BMC) and should be part
        of an introduction or preliminaries (e.g. together with 2.0.1).
   We have moved the background to preliminaries.

  % R2: If Sec 4 is required, it could be made more precise given the formal 
         model introduced in Sec 3.
   Merging the Sec 4 and Sec 5 makes Sec 4 more formal by providing the formal 
   presentation. 
 
  % R2: In Sec 1.4, it would be helpful to understand where the 'large number of 
        graphs' is coming from, though this is somewhat clarified later in the paper.
  We have added the information upfront; in the introduction section.

  % R2: In Sec 5.1 it wasn’t clear what the ’length of the path of the underline 
    graph’ referred to. Is that the graph diameter or some other property? 
    How does the restriction to elementary cycles affect this
  We are only talking about longest simple path. We now refer it with “total no 
  nodes in the graph”. This will cover all elementary cycles. 

  % R2: In 6.1.2, should the condition in PresentE be an ’if and only if’, since 
    at least one molecule is required on each edge?
  Although this requires equality; one direction conditional is sufficient as the 
  other case is covered by the fusion rule. 

  % R2 & R3: Reference [67] is repeated as [68]

  % R3: A 45 minute timeout seems quite short to me, based on similar SAT problems
        I have run in the past. Why did you opt for this cutoff? 
  The choice of the cutoff was arbitrary. 

  % R3: Line 14, page 15: what do you mean by ’parts’ ?
  We meant was missing "components". We have updated the draft with the correction.
 
TODO: Biology related questions

  % R2: Clarify: what role does the activity of molecules on edges
        or in compartments play? 
  
  % R2: the biological description can be simplified to only what is required 
        to understand the model, while relevant references could be provided to 
        supply additional biological details. 
    We have now condensed the biological description.

  % R2: Given that a relatively small number of 9 different organelles/compartments 
       is considered, perhaps a figure indicating these compartments (like the ones
       in the appendix) would be helpful.
    We have updated the Fig. 1 and added 1(C) to indictate these comparments.

  % R2: It was surprising to see parts of Sec 1.4. as part of the introduction 
        because this seems to discuss novel results.
   We have removed this discussion from the front of the paper. 


  % R3: The abstraction of the VTS and the definition of the pairing matrix 
         could be clarified for the reader if the biological background were not 
         quite so separated from the remainder of the manuscript.
   We have added a simple explaination in the introduction to give an overview.

  % R3: I would argue further that some of the detail of the biological section 
         is unecessary.
   We have condensed the details of the biological section.

  % R3: A clear definition of the pairing matrix is missing.
   Although the definition is formally present we have added the definition with 
   explanation of the pairing matrix in subsection Molecular regulation.

  % R3: Figs. 5 and 6 are not referred to in the manuscript, and could easily 
  	have been missed. 
   We have added a reference to these figures in the Example 2. We have also 
   updated the Fig 1 to add schematic Fig 1C of typic eukaryotic cell’s VTS. 

  % R3: The notation and colours used in Fig. 2 should be explained in the 
        figure legend.
  We have added the explaination of notations and colors in Fig 2.

We thank for the other comments, which we appropriately implemented.
