\noindent A characteristic feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of multiple internal membrane-bounded compartments. 
%
These compartments exchange molecules amo\-ngst themselves in small membrane-bounded packets called vesicles~\cite{alberts2002molecular}. 
%
The molecular interaction network that controls the vesicle traffic system involves dozens of varieties of molecules that regulate the flow of cargo. 
%
Due to this, obtaining a complete understanding of the VTS through physical experimentation alone is a hard problem.
%
Highly reduced models of vesicle traffic have previously provided insight into how the chemical composition of various cellular compartments can emerge out of molecular regulation and cargo flow. 
%
However, the high complexity of problems in VTS restricts the use of traditional methods like simulation and statistical reasoning~\cite{mani2016stacking}. 
%The high complexity of problem restricts the use of traditional methods like simulation and statistical reasoning and the requirement of precise analysis makes formal methods an ideal candidate. 
In this paper, using formal methods, we solve the problem of completing incomplete VTS graphs while also considering constraints due to molecular interactions, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of such methods.
