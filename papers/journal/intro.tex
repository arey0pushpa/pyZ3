A characteristic feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of multiple internal membrane bound compartments. These compartments exchange molecules amongst themselves in small membrane bound packets called vesicles ~\cite{alberts2002molecular}.  The molecular interaction network that controls the vesicle transport system involves tens of kinds of molecules which regulate each others activities and modes of action. Due to this, obtaining a complete understanding of the vesicle transport system through physical experimentation alone is a hard problem.

The high complexity of problems in VTS also restricts the use of traditional methods like simulation and statistical reasoning~\cite{mani2016wine, mani2016stacking}. 
%The high complexity of problem restricts the use of traditional methods like simulation and statistical reasoning and the requirement of precise analysis makes formal methods an ideal candidate. 
In this paper, using formal methods, we solve the problem of completing incomplete VTS graphs while also considering constraints due to molecular interactions, thereby demonstrating the aptitude of such methods.
