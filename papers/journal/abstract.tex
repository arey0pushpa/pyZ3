%\ankit{An outline of the Abstract.}
Vesicle Traffic Systems (VTSs) are the material transport
mechanisms among the compartments inside the biological cells.
%
The compartments are viewed as nodes that are labeled with the
containing chemicals and the transport channels
are similarly viewed as labeled edges between the nodes.
%
Several interesting questions about VTS translates to combinatorial
search and synthesis problem. 
%
We present novel SAT, SMT and QBF based encodings of the properties
over vesicle traffic systems and a tool that searches for the networks
that satisfies the properties using these solvers. 
%
Understanding VTSs is an ongoing area of research and for many cells
they are partially known...
%
In our experiments, we show that our tool can search for network of sizes that are considered
to be relevant by biologists.
