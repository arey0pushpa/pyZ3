Vesicle Traffic Systems (VTSs) transport cargo among the intracellular compartments of eukaryotic biological cells.
%
The compartments are viewed as nodes that are labeled by their chemical identity and the transport vesicles are similarly viewed as labeled edges between the nodes.
%
Several interesting questions about VTSs translate to combinatorial search and synthesis problems. 
%
We present novel SAT, SMT and QBF based encodings of the properties over vesicle traffic systems and a tool that searches for the networks that satisfy properties that are related to transport consistency conditions using these solvers. 
%
In our numerical experiments, we show that our tool can search for networks of sizes that are relevant to real cellular systems.

% Vesicle Traffic Systems(VTSs) are the material transport
