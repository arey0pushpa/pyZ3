In this section we will present a list of problems that may arise from
synthesis of VTSs from partial available information.

\subsection{Problem Statements}


Our objective is to find missing parts of a partially known VTSs.
%
We will consider several variations of the problem.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning activity functions
\item Modifying labels of the nodes and edges
\item Adding missing edges
\item Adding
\end{itemize}
