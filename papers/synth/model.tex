\ashu{Discuss the model in Biological terms.}

%
Therefore, the model only has aspects of a network or a graph.\\

\ankit{Discuss the yeast and eukaryotes example graph}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complex form using three Q-SNAREs and one R-SNARE. In order for a vesicle to fuse to it's corresponding target compartment this combination has to be present.
\item In the graph shown the R-SNAREs are always in active. Every combination is formed by three active Q-SNAREs and one active R-SNARE.
\item  Qai, Qbi, Qci and Ri are just dummy names, real biological names can be found in the below table. 
\item In the diagram white circle molecules are always active. Other edge labels are inactive molecules.
\item Pairing matrix restriction: ith R-SNARE can fuse with only the corresponding ith Q-SNARES and vice-versa. No other combination is allowed.
\item Concept of v and t-SNAREs is replaced by Q and R-SNAREs. 
\end{enumerate}
