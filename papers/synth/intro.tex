Vesicle Traffic Systems(VTS) are the material transport mechanisms
among the compartments inside the biological cells~\cite{vtsIntro}.

\ashu{Describe VTS in detail}
%
Vesicle Traffic Systems are the transport mechanisms inside the cells.
%
Different compartments are viewed as nodes and transport channels are
nodes between the graphs.

\ashu{Make a case for incomplete knowledge of VTSs.}
%Now we will work on
Since VTSs are partially known, 
%
the labels may not have been fully observed.


\ashu{Make a case for expected properties!!}
Furthermore, it is a matter of debate what properties the VTSs should
have, such as stability, i.e., every chemical that is leaving a
compartment comes back.


\ashu{Speculative: Make a case for completing partial parts of VTSs!!}

We model a VTS as a labelled graph.
%
Each compartment of VTS is a node of the graph and and the
transport channels between the nodes is an edge.
%
The set of molecules present in a compartment is the label of
the compartment.
% 
Similarly, the set of transported molecules carried by an edge is the label
on the edge.
%
A molecule in a node or edge may be active or inactive. 
%
The constraints discussed on the VTSs that allow a VTS to be feasible
are combinatorial in nature, for example stability or 3-connectedness.

We consider several versions of the synthesis problem involving different
parts of VTSs that can be synthesized, such as modifying labels,
adding/deleting edges, learning activity functions, and adding nodes.
%
In order to synthesize the parts of a VTS such that it satisfies the constraints, 
we encode the synthesis problem into a satisfiability of QBF with uninterpreted
Boolean functions.
