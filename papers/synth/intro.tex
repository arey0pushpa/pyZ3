Vesicle Traffic Systems(VTS) are the material transport mechanisms
among the compartments inside the biological cells.\cite{vtsIntro}

\ashu{Describe VTS in detail}


Vesicle Traffic Systems are the transport mechanisms inside the cells.
%
Different compartments are viewed as nodes and transport channels are
nodes between the graphs.

The labels may not have been fully observed.

Furthermore, it is a matter of debate what properties
the VTSs should have, such as stability, i.e., every
chemical that is leaving a compartment comes back.

Subsequently, it can be potentially useful in guiding biologists
