%Motivate VTS
\ashu{Reduce the intro by half page}

Eukaryotic cells, including human cells, consist of multiple membrane bound compartments.
Material is transported among these compartments by the vesicle transport system (VTS) []. Briefly,
the source compartment produces a membrane bound packet of molecules called a vesicle. After
release, this vesicle specifically recognizes the correct target compartment within the cell, and fuses
with it. The molecules that form the machinery of the VTS are known. \todo{connect to function }{We also know a lot about the specific functions} of these molecules and how these molecules interact amongst each other. In spite of this detailed knowledge at the level of the molecules, the structure of the VTS network, or the road-map of the eukaryotic cell, is far from complete. The current knowledge of the network is put together from a patch work of biological experiments. This information is scattered across several publications. Even after this information is collected and put together, we find that the network obtained is still not complete; new vesicles and new contents in previously known vesicles are constantly being discovered. The synthesis for the unknown pieces may be assisted by computation on the graph model of VTSs.

%In this work, we use a model described in [] to find out, given a partial
%VTS graph and details about interactions amongst its molecules, what the complete graph of the
%VTS could look like. (Please look at appendix A for the detailed discussion on pros and cons of the

%Eukaryotic cells, including human cells, consists of multiple compartments.
%
%Vesicle Traffic Systems(VTSs) are the material transport mechanisms among the compartments inside the cells~\cite{vtsIntro}.
%
%Almost all subsystems of the cells depend on VTSs.
%
%Therefore, understanding how VTSs functions is one of the key
%questions of cell biology.
%
In this paper, we are looking at the computational questions 
arise from the VTSs.
%
In the following, we use the model of VTSs that has been presented
in~\cite{VTS}.
%
Please look at appendix~\ref{sec:model}
for the detailed discussion on pros and cons of the model.

% Describe VTS in detail
While VTSs transports molecules, VTSs are also
regulated by the molecules.
%
Each compartment contains a set of molecules.
%
The molecules are transported to the other compartments via
unidirectional channels.  
%
The molecules in a compartment may be active or not active.
%
Similarly, a molecule can be active or inactive in a channel. 
%
The active molecules are the regulators of the channels.
%
A channel is enabled by a pair of molecules
such that one occurs in the channel and the other
occurs in the destination compartment.
%
Both the molecules must be active in the channel
and compartment respectively.
%
The pairs are called {\em fusing} molecules and analogously
the channel is considered to be {\em fused} with the
destination compartment.
%
Not all the pairs of molecules can participate in the fusion, the
potential fusion pairs are usually determined by biological experiments.
%
To ensure effective regulation, the fusing molecule pairs must be
unique for each fused channel-compartment pair.
%
A molecule that has participated in a fusion must not interfere
with fusion at different compartments or channels.
%
Therefore, the molecule must be inactive in appropriate compartments.
%
The activity of molecules is regulated by the other molecules, i.e.,
the presence and absence of the other molecules in a compartment or
channel may make the molecule active or inactive.
%
We call this regulation as {\em activity functions}.

% Defending our model
%
In the VTS model, we assume that the system is in study state and
the concentrations of the molecules in the compartments do not change over time.
%
We model the system as a labelled graph, where compartments are nodes and
transport channels are edges.
%
The set of molecules present and their activity in a compartment or
a channel is the label of the respective node or edge.
%
The regulation controls are defined by a fusion pairing relation
containing pairs of molecules and activity
Boolean functions.
%
Since the system is in study state, we expect that any molecule that
leaves a compartment must come back via some path on the graph.
%
We call this property of VTS as {\em stability}.

% Partial info defence
%
Although the VTSs are important, our understanding of VTSs are partial.
%
It largely means that the current knowledge is due to the patch work
of biological experiments~\cite{model} for identifying the compartments,
channels, molecules, and their activity and regulatory control.
%
Often the information is scattered around in several publications.
%
Even after with some effort we may collate all the known information about
a VTS, we may still have unknown pieces of the system; new vesicles and new contents in previously known vesicles are constantly being discovered.
%
%{Speculative: Make a case for completing partial parts of VTSs!!}
%
For example, we may suspect that some edges may not have been
discovered in a VTS that does not satisfy the stability condition.
%
The synthesis for the unknown pieces may be {\em assisted} by computation on
the graph model of VTSs.
%
In this paper, we consider several versions of the synthesis problem
involving different parts of VTSs that can be synthesized, such as
modifying labels, adding/deleting edges, and learning activity functions.
%
We also consider variation on the properties against which we do synthesis,
namely stability, and $k$-connectedness that states
that VTS remains connected after removing any $k-1$ edges.
%
In order to synthesize the parts of a VTS such that it satisfies the
constraints, we encode the synthesis problem into a satisfiability of
quantified Boolean formulas(QBFs). 
%

We have implemented the encoding in a highly flexible tool,
which can handle a wide range of synthesis query.
%
We have applied our tool on two found-in-nature VTSs, namely
M1~\cite{} and S1~\cite{}.
%
We have also applied our tool on various synthetic examples to
demonstrate that our tool scale upto the graph size ??, which
is the size of typical VTSs in a eukaryotic cell.

The following are the contributions of this work:
\begin{itemize}
\item We have identified an interesting application of
  the synthesis technology.
\item We have developed encoding of the synthesis problem in QBF.
\item A user friendly and scalable tool based on a well known SMT solver Z3
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
%
In section~\ref{sec:prelim}, we present the graph model of VTSs and encoding of several
constraints on VTSs.
%
In section~\ref{sec:encoding}, we present the synthesis problems and their
encoding into QBF satisfiability.
%
In section~\ref{sec:experiments}, we present our implementation and experimental results.
%
We discuss related work in~\ref{sec:related} and conclude in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
