We have implemented the encodings in a tool
called~\ourtool\footnote{{\url{https://github.com/arey0pushpa/pyZ3}}}.
%
The tool takes a partially defined VTS as input in a custom designed
input language.
%
The input is then converted to the constraints over VTS. 
%
The tool can not only synthesize the above-discussed queries, but also their
combinations.
%
For example, our tool can modify labels of nodes or edges while
learning activity functions.
%
Our tool is developed in C++ and uses~\zthree~\cite{z3} infrastructure for
processing formulas. 
%
Since some of the formulas involve alternation of quantifiers over
Boolean variables Z3 is not a suitable choice for those examples.
%
We translate the formulas created by Z3 tool into a standard
QDIMACS~\cite{qdimacs} format and use as an input for QBF solvers. 
%
We use~\depqbf~\cite{lonsing2010depqbf} for solving of QBF formulas. 
%
Our tool includes about 7000 lines of code.

We have applied~\ourtool~on six partially defined VTSs.
%
The results are presented in table~\ref{tab:qf-graph} for both the solvers
\depqbf and \zthree.
%
To use~\zthree, we remove \texttt{Connected} constraints, such that the queries becomes
quantifier-free.
%
% The experiments were conducted on a machine,
% with \ashu{?}MHz processor, \ashu{?}GB memory, and 900s timeout.
%
The experiments were done on a machine with Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4030U
CPU @ 1.90GHz processor and 4GB RAM with 30 min (1800 sec) timeout.
%The experiments were conducted with a 900s timeout.
%
The first four VTSs are synthetic but inspire from literature for
typical motifs in VTSs. 
The third VTS is a subgraph of the last VTS.
%
%
The fifth VTS is taken from~\cite{burri2004complete}.
%
The last VTS represent mammalian SNARE map created by studying the literature references.  

The table shows timing for various synthesis queries.
%
For each synthesis query, we have two columns.
%
One column reports the timing and the other reports the minimum changes
needed to obtain a valid VTS.
%
$\infty$ indicates that any number of changes with the synthesis query
search space can obtain the VTS.
%
%\ashu{@ankit: please discuss all the synthesis queries in the table.}
In the table, we are reporting five synthesis queries
%
The first one only adds new labelled edges to the graph.
%
We have ranked the all possible graph edits with the simple rank of
minimum updates.
% %
% Our tools were able to complete the graphs by adding five new edges
% and nine new molecules in 210s.
%
The second query adds new labels to the edge.
%  and was able to
% fix the graphs with eleven new molecule labels in 180s.
%
The third query synthesizes NNF Boolean functions only containing
$\land$ and $\lor$ gates for activity functions, while allowing
more edges to be added.
%
The result shows the basic template of 4 leaves and 3 gates.
%
% The tool was able to synthesize the Boolean functions in 470s.
%
To illustrate the versatility of our tool, the fourth query
synthesizes $3$-CNF functions (encoding not presented).
%  and was able to
% synthesis the results for all graphs in 500s.
%
Finally, we report queries that allows both addition and deletion of edges, and labels
of node and labels. 


%
%Our experiments suggest that the synthesis problems are solvable by modern 
%solvers and the synthesis technology may be useful for biological research.
