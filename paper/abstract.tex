In Biology, there are several questions that translate to combinatorial 
search.
%
For example, vesicle traffic systems in biological cells exhibit
several graph properties such as three connectivity and
a natural question arises for biologists that what are all possible
networks for various combinations of those properties.
%
This analysis makes several explicit predictions about how SNAREs and their regulators are transported, used, recycled and re-used across a cell and provide biologist experiment testable hypothesis which contributes to current understanding of the vesicle traffic system. ....

%
In this paper, we present SAT/QBF encodings of the properties over
vesicle traffic systems and a tool that searches for the networks
that satisfies the properties using SAT/QBF solvers.
%
In our experiments, we show that our tool can search for networks of
sizes that are considered to be relevant by biologists.
