\textbf{SAT, Bio and Graph}
Satisfiability was the first NP complete problem discovered by cook in his famous paper [ref]. SAT solvers have seen an surge in the handling of millions of variables. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reasoning over Biological Networks using Maximum Satisfiability.
\item BioGraphE: high-performance bionetwork analysis using the Biological Graph Environment.
\item Generalized k-ary tanglegrams on level graphs: A satisfiability-based approach and its evaluation.
\item SMT-Based Analysis of Biological Computation.
\item A SAT-based algorithm for finding attractors in synchronous Boolean networks.
\item ILP/SMT-Based Method for Design of Boolean Networks Based on Singleton Attractors.
\item Exact DFA Identification Using SAT Solvers
\item Timing Robustness in the Budding and Fission Yeast Cell Cycles.
\item Solving Subgraph Epimorphism Problems using CLP
